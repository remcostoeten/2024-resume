  about:
    "Front-end engineer with a degree in graphic design. Aspiring to be more than a divjesschuiver.",
  summary:
    "Started off my journey in e-commerce building custom Magento 2 webshops. After that, I moved to SaaS, in-house for multinationals and currently employed in SaaS exclusively for non-profit and government organizations. My current go-to stack is Next.js (React), TypeScript, GraphQL/REST/own API paired with any styling solution whether it's Tailwind, modules, or styled components, and if needed a (cloud/BaaS) database provider like Firebase, Convex, or SQLite.",
  summarytwo:
    " Although my current focus is front-end focused, I have strong all-round technology interest and am quite involved in the space. I love exploring newer tools (e.g. Svelte, Solid, Qwik) but also have an interest in learning more complex languages like Rust, Zig, OCaml and on the short-term Go. I've done a little Python (scrapers, text-mutate-tools) and some Lua (game engine scripting, NeoVim configuration) and quite some Bash.",
